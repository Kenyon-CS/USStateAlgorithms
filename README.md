# USStateAlgorithms
Using the US States to demonstrate C++ STL algorithms

Hereâ€™s the structure for a C++ program that will demonstrate many STL algorithms, using state data stored in a class and loaded from a CSV file:

Steps
1. Class Definition: Create a State class to store state data.
1. CSV Parsing: Load state data from a CSV file into a vector of State objects.
1. Sorting: Demonstrate sorting by state name, population, and per capita GDP.
1. Partitioning: Partition states based on population and also randomly into two vectors.
1. Searching: Search for states by a keyword in the state motto.
1. Transforming: Apply a 20% population growth transformation.
1. Set Operations: Perform union and intersection on random state vectors.
1. Numeric Operations: Compute the sum of area, GDP, and population.
